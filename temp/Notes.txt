Firstly, here's a detailed summary of what I understand the desired features to be. Please tell me if this looks complete to you.
- A landing page (never explicitly specified but you'll definitely want one).
- A rulebook page (never explicitly specified but you'll probably want one).
- Players should be able to log in with Discord.
- A season (schedule) page to list past and upcoming matches in the given season (defaults to the current season). You linked [this](https://summitseasons.com/season/474) as an example. What do you think about the schedule on [LoL Esports](https://lolesports.com/en-US/)? The season name/number will be displayed. The season's stats (leaderboards) will be displayed in a separate tab (I need you to tell me which ones). The season's standings will be displayed in another tab (like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1Uv4o1QEJSqf58t2Nl6B9OxLfhXEhrPeHpbRr2K8jMiI/htmlview)). The playoffs bracket will be displayed once the playoffs begin. The teams in the season will be displayed. Matches will display the names/codes and icons (and maybe colors?) of the teams that will play, the format of the match, and for completed matches, will list the match score and winner. Matches will be listed in order by week. Administrators will be able to modify the season name/number, matches and teams, including a button to automatically generate matches for a season. Clicking a match will bring you to the corresponding match page. Clicking a team will bring you to the corresponding team page.
 - LoL Esports page is better. Leaderboards of kills, deaths, assists, first bloods, damage, objective damage, towers taken, first towers, vision score, wards placed, control wards, creep score, gold, gold difference (5, 10, 15 minutes), creep score difference (5, 10, 15 minutes), largest multi-kill, largest killing spree, solo kills, double kills, triple kills, quadra kills, penta kills, game time, wins, losses, and games played.
- A match page to view the details of a given match. The match's season and week and the teams that are playing in the match will be displayed. For completed and ongoing matches, the match score and games will be displayed. For completed matches, the match winner will be displayed. Administrators will be able to override the match's week and/or teams for matches that haven't been played. Administrators will be able to delete matches. Clicking a team will bring you to the corresponding team page. Clicking a game will bring you to the corresponding game page.
- A team page to view the details of a given team. The team's name, icon/logo, color?, code?, captain, season, pool, players, and **matches** played will be displayed. Players will be listed with their name and a player-selected champion skin background image. For teams from past seasons, there will be an indication if the team won the season that they did so. The team's stats will also be displayed (I need you to tell me which ones). The team's captain and administrators will be able to modify the team's name, color?, code?, and icon/logo. Administrators will be able to modify the team's captain, pool, and players. Clicking on a player will bring you to the corresponding player page. Clicking on a match will bring you to the corresponding match page. Clicking on the season will bring you to the corresponding season page.
- A player page to view the details of a given player. The player's Discord account, nickname (if provided; primary Riot account name otherwise), Riot accounts, biography/description (if provided), teams, **games** played, and seasons won will be displayed. The player's stats will also be displayed (I need you to tell me which ones). The player's recent non-GCS (i.e. norms, ranked, etc.) games played and norms/ranked stats will be displayed in a separate tab (think [OP.GG](https://www.op.gg/) or [U GG](https://u.gg/) but for all of the user's accounts; alternatively, a multi link to either of those sites or another could be provided). Users that are viewing their own page and administrators will be able to modify the user's nickname, Riot accounts, and biography/description. Administrators viewing the page will be able to modify the user's Discord account, teams, and administrator status, and will be able to ban the user until a given date. Clicking on a team will bring you to the corresponding team page. Clicking on a game will bring you to the corresponding game page.
- A game page to view the details of a given game. The players in the game, the teams in the game (if applicable), and the match that the game belongs to (if applicable) will be displayed. For upcoming games, players that will play in the game will be able to view a tournament code to join the game. For current and completed games, the game's Riot ID will be displayed. For completed games, the game's stats will be displayed (I need you to tell me which ones). Clicking on a player will bring you to the corresponding player page. Clicking on the match (if applicable) will bring you to the corresponding match page. Clicking on a team (if applicable) will bring you to the corresponding team page.
- Generic pages for each of seasons, teams, matches, and games will exist for administrators to create new instances of the corresponding type from.

The prospective schema to implement the features listed above is as follows. If you notice any field that is missing that you'd like to track, please mention it. It is possible but tedious to modify these later on, so I'd rather make any adjustments before implementing the database.
- Player: Discord ID, nickname, Riot accounts, biography/description, champion skin profile picture/background, unban date (if applicable), administrator status. Teams and seasons played will be stored elsewhere in the database.
- Team: captain, season, pool, players, name, code (2-4 letters; will make the schedule look nicer), icon/logo, color?, whether or not they won their season.
- Season: name/number, start date (this can be skipped if the seasons are given a number instead of a name; only necessary for ordering). Teams will be stored elsewhere in the database.
- Match: season, week, teams, format. Games and winner will be stored elsewhere in the database.
- Game: match, Riot ID, tournament code, players, winner.

Finally, some questions that came up while I was writing all of that:
- What do you want on the landing page?
 - A video, the discord link, the twitch link, a blurb that Nerve will write, and embed the stream if it's live.
- Do you want dark and light themes or just dark? If you want a light theme, I'll need colors for it.
 - Just a dark theme.
- How important is it to you that the website displays well on mobile devices/small screens?
 - Mobile is not that important.
- The font that is specified for callouts on the branding document, "Champagne & Limousines," requires a donation for commercial use. If you want to use it in logos/on the website, you'll need to either contact the creator of the font or not accept Twitch donations (et cetera). Otherwise, I'll need you to decide on an alternative font.
 - Designer "myshkamushka" already donated for the font.
- Would you like to move sign-ups to the website so that you don't have to manually input everything from the Google Form?
 - Yes.
- Would you like a Discord integration so that users can do things like get their next tournament code or sign up without accessing the website? This would also be a good starting point if you want to eventually roll inhouses into the website.
 - Yes.
- Would you like some sort of system for ranking players to help captains with the draft? If so, which metric would you like to use? Would you like a special page on the website for captains to draft from?
 - Putting draft in would be awesome, but they're just placing based on rank for now.

Data Dragon notes:
- Versions list at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/api/versions.json (newest first).
- Languages list at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/languages.json.
- Realm-specific version information at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/realms/na.json, where `na` should be replaced by the realm code.
 - Includes the Data Dragon CDN base URL, the region's language, and the region's Data Dragon version.
- Champion list at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.24.1/data/en_US/champion.json, where `14.24.1` should be replaced by the Data Dragon version and `en_US` should be replaced by the language.
 - Includes a list of champion IDs as keys on an object.
- Individual champions at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/14.24.1/data/en_US/champion/Aatrox.json, replacing the version and language as listed above and `Aatrox` depending on the champion ID.
 - Includes a list of skins with names and numbers.
- Individual champion splash arts at https://ddragon.leagueoflegends.com/cdn/img/champion/splash/Aatrox_0.jpg, replacing the champion ID as listed above and replacing `0` with the skin number.

Other ideas:
- Allow players to link streaming accounts. For games that are in progress, show links to the players' streams if they are live. Maybe put this on the player cards?
- Restrict PUUIDs that can join tournament codes.
- Inhouse bot.
- Generate draft links? Will want to use blind pick if so.
- 404 page.
- Button for admins to re-cache game result data.
- Vanity URLs.
- Rename to Gauntlet Championship Series (GCS) - new branding incoming.
- Ability to mark other players that you do/don't want to play with? Maybe more information in a sort of "player review?"
